### Python Code Style

- **Follow PEP 8** style guidelines
- **Use Black** for code formatting
- **Use descriptive variable names**
- **Include type hints** where appropriate
- **Write docstrings** for all functions and classes

Example:
```python
def calculate_risk_score(
    age: int, 
    symptoms: List[str], 
    medical_history: List[str]
) -> float:
    """
    Calculate patient risk score based on demographics and symptoms.
    
    Args:
        age: Patient age in years
        symptoms: List of reported symptoms
        medical_history: List of existing medical conditions
        
    Returns:
        Risk score between 0.0 and 1.0
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If age is negative or symptoms list is empty
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Documentation Standards

- **Clear and concise** explanations
- **Code examples** for complex features
- **Healthcare context** where relevant
- **Updated README.md** for significant changes
- **Inline comments** for complex logic

### Testing Standards

- **Unit tests** for all new functions
- **Integration tests** for user workflows
- **Edge case testing** for healthcare scenarios
- **Performance tests** for AI components
- **Accessibility testing** for UI changes

## üè• Healthcare Compliance

### Important Considerations

When contributing to healthcare technology:

1. **Patient Safety First**
   - Never compromise on medical accuracy
   - Include appropriate disclaimers
   - Validate medical information with experts

2. **Privacy Protection**
   - No real patient data in code
   - Secure handling of test data
   - Follow HIPAA guidelines

3. **Accessibility**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard navigation support

4. **Medical Accuracy**
   - Verify medical information with sources
   - Include citations for medical claims
   - Get expert review for clinical features

### Sensitive Areas

Be extra careful when working on:

- **Emergency detection algorithms**
- **Triage logic and scoring**
- **Medical advice generation**
- **Drug interaction checking**
- **Age-specific recommendations**
